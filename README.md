# Ritchi
### An Ine software. Ritchi the easy way for custom discord rich presence. Made for the 9INE community.

# Discord RPC Tool.
Discord RPC is a library for interfacing your game with a locally running Discord desktop client. It's known to work on Windows, macOS, and Linux
Ritchi is a discord rich presence tool made in JavaScript, its very lightweight and easy to use/customize.

# Customization
To customize/setup your custom status open `customization.json`. There you can put all the info you can find at the discord developer portal and customize your text. Thing like images will be added though the developer application. \_name is the text that you see when you hover over the image.
`The name of the image will also be the name of your image key in the config file.`

# FakeGame mode
With Ritchi its fakegame mode you can now send invites thru discord and people can ask to join ur rpc, this doesn't actually work cause it doesn't run any software other than node wich can't be joined but it looks cool and you can do some cool pranks with it. Also by enabling this there will show a timer under ur rpc.

# Installation.
On Windows devices just open Ritchi.bat and if its your first time launching open Install.bat too. This Ine service is local hosted and not bound to your account-token so its not 24/7 if you turn off your device
On other devices like linux and mac open a console and type `npm i` only execute that command on first use to install the packages and then type `node .` to start the software if node/npm is not installed on your device goto [this link](https://nodejs.org/en/) on some devices you might have to install them both apart through your operating systems package command. Like on arch `pacman -S nodejs npm`.
Now you should be able to see the status if not goto Discord > Settings > Game Activity > Enable and add Ritchi.
